            generate errors or harm to the electronic documents, data, or physical and logical systems of CodeGenia or
            third parties; as well as hinder the access of other users to the website and its services through the
            massive consumption of computing resources through which CodeGenia provides its services.<br />
            Attempt to access other users' email accounts or restricted areas of CodeGenia's or third-party computer

            Infringe intellectual or industrial property rights, as well as violate the confidentiality of CodeGenia's
            or third parties' information.<br />
            Impersonate another user.<br />
            Reproduce, copy, distribute, make available, or otherwise publicly communicate, transform, or modify the

            advertising purposes and send any type of advertising and communications for sales or other commercial
            purposes without prior request or consent.<br />
            All the content of the website, such as texts, photographs, graphics, images, icons, technology, software,
            as well as its graphic design and source codes, constitute a work owned by CodeGenia, without any
            exploitation rights over them being transferred to the user beyond what is strictly necessary for the proper
            use of the website. In short, users accessing this website can view the content and make private copies
            authorized, provided that the reproduced elements are not subsequently transferred to third parties,
            installed on servers connected to networks, or subjected to any kind of exploitation.<br />
            Similarly, all trademarks, trade names, or distinctive signs of any kind appearing on the website are the
            property of CodeGenia, and it cannot be understood that the use or access to the website grants the user any

            other act not expressly authorized by the holder of the exploitation rights are prohibited.<br />
            The establishment of a hyperlink does not imply, in any case, the existence of a relationship between
            CodeGenia and the owner of the website where it is established, nor the acceptance and approval by CodeGenia
            of its contents or services. CodeGenia is not responsible for the use each user makes of the materials made
            available on this website or the actions performed based on them.

        <h3>4.1 EXCLUSION OF GUARANTEES AND LIABILITY FOR ACCESS AND USE</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">
            The content of this website is general and has a purely informative purpose, without guaranteeing full
            access to all content, nor its exhaustiveness, accuracy, validity, or suitability for a specific purpose.
            CodeGenia excludes, as far as the legal system allows, any liability for damages of any kind resulting
            from:<br />
            The impossibility of accessing the website or the lack of truthfulness, accuracy, exhaustiveness, and/or
            timeliness of the content, as well as the existence of faults and defects of all kinds in the content
            transmitted, disseminated, stored, made available, or accessed through the website or the services it
            offers.<br />
            The presence of viruses or other elements in the content that may cause alterations in users' computer
            systems, electronic documents, or data.<br />
            The breach of laws, good faith, public order, commercial usage, and this legal notice as a consequence of
            improper use of the website. In particular, and as an example, CodeGenia is not responsible for the actions
            of third parties that infringe intellectual and industrial property rights, business secrets, rights to
            honor, personal and family privacy, and one's image, as well as regulations on unfair competition and
            illegal advertising.<br />
            CodeGenia also declines any responsibility for the information found outside this website and not directly
            managed by our webmaster. The function of the links appearing on this website is exclusively to inform the
            user of the existence of other sources likely to expand the content offered by this site. CodeGenia does not
            guarantee or take responsibility for the functioning or accessibility of the linked sites; nor does it
            suggest, invite, or recommend visiting them, and therefore is not responsible for the results obtained.
            CodeGenia is not responsible for the establishment of hyperlinks by third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 PROCEDURE IN CASE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">

            the use of any content and/or the performance of any activity on the web pages included or accessible
            through the website, they must notify CodeGenia properly identifying themselves and specifying the alleged
            infringements.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 PUBLICATIONS</h3>

            regulations, plans, general provisions, and acts that must be formally published in the official journals of
            public administrations, which are the only instruments that attest to their authenticity and content. The
